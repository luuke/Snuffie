- add remembering old sensor status in case of losing the line
- think of making more variables as volatile

- for final version code size reducing and speed optimizing read 'AVR035 Efficient C Coding for AVR' PDF file.
- volatile uint8_t sensor_status[16]; //TODO: change for 16bit bitfield -> easier to detect many unique cases by value of variable
